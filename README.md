# SimpleLocalize-CLI 

## What it does?

Application will find all keys which are used by [https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl).
Like:
```jsx
<FormattedMessage id="some_key"/>
```
or 
```js
intl.formatMessage(defineMessages({
  id: "some_key"
});
```
Keys will be pushed to the [SimpleLocalize cloud](https://app.simplelocalize.io/login), where you will be able to manage translations for multiple languages with ease, and publish them to our CDN.

Consider use of [`react-intl-simplelocalize`](https://github.com/simplelocalize/react-intl-simplelocalize) for the best experience.
